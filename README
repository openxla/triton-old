# OpenXLA Triton Fork

This repository contains a fork of Triton for use by the OpenXLA Project.

The purpose of this fork is to keep Triton up-to-date with the latest LLVM
version.
We will seek to stay aligned with the upstream community for substantive work with it.
Currently, for LLVM compatibility and stability reasons this fork is mirroring
pre-MLIR Triton, but we seek to switch shortly.

This repository will not accept PRs or issues. These
should be directed upstream instead. Contact the OpenXLA team for questions
about this fork.
